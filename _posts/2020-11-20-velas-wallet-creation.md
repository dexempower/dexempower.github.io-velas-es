## DESKTOP & WEB GUIDE

# WALLET CREATION GRUIDE

### INTRODUCTION

-  This manual book contains the steps for creating the wallet at
https://wallet.velas.com
The whole process is done from our own browser or Velas Wallet App, we
can use any known browser (Chrome / Firefox / Opera / Safari)
-  We must ensure that we are using a computer free of viruses, malware, or
any other type of software that could put at risk our funds, it is advisable to
have an antivirus activated and run analyzes periodically if we use this
equipment daily.
-  Once we have finished configuring the wallet, we will only be able to access
from the computer itself using the PIN/Password that we have chosen, if in the
future we wish to access from another computer, we will have to use our 24
recovery words to access
-  The wallet stores certain information in the browser that we use to allow us
to access it later only with using a PIN, in case of clearing caches and cookies
it is very possible that we will be forced to restore the wallet again using our
24 recovery words


  
**LANGUAGE SELECTION**
 - **a)** When the first time we access the web https://wallet.velas.com, the menu
will automatically appear to choose our language, we select the one we want
and in this way, we will begin the creation of the wallet

**CREATION OF RECOVERY DOCUMENT**

 - **e)** It is highly recommended to create two copies of the document shown
below, writing down the 24 words by looking at your screen, a typing error can
leave us without full access to our wallet . So you need to double check it.
