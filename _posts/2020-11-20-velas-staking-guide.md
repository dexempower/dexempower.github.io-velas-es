# GUIDE TO DELEGATE STAKE IN VELAS WALLET
### INTRODUCTION

- The Velas Network is made up of a set of computers (nodes) distributed throughout the world.
-  Any user who holds 1,000,000 VLX or more can run a node and setup a ¨Pool¨.
  -  Users who hold 10,000 VLX or more can use ¨Pools¨, to delegate their VLX and generate rewards.
-  Every 6 hours (currently) 19 nodes are chosen based on their reputation. When a node is chosen, it will generate a reward at the end of the epoch and it will be distributed between and all delegates.
- Nodes and delegates generate rewards based on balance, the distribution of the reward generated in a node is 40% the for pool organizer (as a minimum), and 60% to be distributed among all the delegates based on their balance.
- The process is done through a smart contract that the user can finish and withdraw their balance whenever they want, totally safe and secure for the User.
